          Immigrant parents may face detainment or deportation with little warning. Since parents may work in the same location or be in the same location when picked up by ICE/immigration, their children can be left without any legal guardian. When picked up by ICE/Immigration, parents are often unavailable or inaccessible for days or weeks (and can even be deported before ever having access to their children or family). Parents can sign a power of attorney for the minor children to give guardianship of their child to someone they trust, which takes effect only if they are detained or deported.
